Executable Decision Trees is an ML model deployment tool developed as part of an academic project. The tool parses CSV files to generate decision trees using the CART algorithm. These decision trees are then trans-compiled into C/C++ for execution in a POSIX environment. Additionally, the tool supports generating JAR files by creating bytecode using Apache BCEL.
